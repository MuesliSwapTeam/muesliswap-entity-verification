# MuesliSwap Entity Verification 🏢✔

The official repository to register as an entity for [Onchain Token Verification](https://onchain-token-verification.muesliswap.com/).  
As a registered entity, you will automatically appear as trusted in the [Entity section](https://onchain-token-verification.muesliswap.com/entities), and users will see which tokens you marked as trusted or untrusted.

We uniquely identify entities via their Public Key Hash (PKH).  
To register, please do the following:  
📄 Create a pull request with the correct JSON entity description in the [entities](entities) folder. The file name should be \<PKH\>.json.  
🧐 Make sure that your PKH is displayed somewhere on your website.  
💸 Leave a comment with the transaction id showing you submitted 50 ADA to the [payment address](https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1qx3hdgge0w8asfryr2duqeajy9qnz957u660f07lghzacn4e2cutfnhq0kzd5azy95vngvn2nl0x04kxvtfrhych3lcqvwsu7a)
